        <p>For Ultrafabrics Holdings Co. supplying seating material to Tesla Inc., United Airlines Holdings Inc. and
            furniture makers isn't just good for the environment, it's a potentially lucrative, though challenging,
            business.</p>
        <p>The goal for Noboru Yoshimura, 60, president of the Tokyo-based manufacturer, is to make the company's name
            synonymous with synthetic leather. "More and more people are using our leather," he said in an interview.
            "We're consciously developing premium products, and that strategy is in line with the times."</p>
        <p>For years, leather made from processed cowhides or sheepskin was seen as a premium option for car buyers.
            Now, environmentally conscious consumers are seeking out products that don't involve the slaughter of animals,
            such as plant-based meat. Airlines are turning to the leather-like material to take advantage of their lower
            weight to save on fuel and reduce carbon emissions. As a result, the global synthetic leather market is on track
            to reach $67.2 billion by 2030, according to Straits Research.</p>
        <p>Investors appear to agree on the opportunity for Ultrafabrics, which hasn't fully disclosed its list of
            customers and declined to comment. Cleantechnica last year reported that Ultrafabrics is a Tesla supplier,
            citing a Tesla Owners Group. Ultrafabrics lists United Airlines, among other airlines, as their client.</p>
        <p>After a brutal year in 2020, when the pandemic wreaked havoc on the global auto industry, the company's stock
            has quintupled as sales and profitability recovered. Ultrafabrics is forecasting operating profit of $18.7
            million on sales of $126 million for the fiscal year through March, while analysts, on average, are projecting
            profit of $20 million and $129 million yen in revenue. In its previous incarnation, Ultrafabrics was Daiichi Kasei,
            a materials supplier that created a material that is strong, resilient and lightweight, while soft like genuine leather.
            Four layers are weaved together to create a leather-like texture, combining a back cloth, a form, cushion layer and
            a final protective film.</p>
        <p>While vegan leather may appeal to consumers and help reduce weight penalties for airlines, the majority of
            the material is made from plastic-based polyurethane chloride and polyurethane, raising questions whether
            production and disposal is good for the environment. Some variants using cork, bark, or apple peel, do exist.</p>
        <p>After merging in 2017 with U.S.-based Ultrafabrics, the combined entity changed its name and kept its listing
            in Japan. The legacy operations of Daiichi Kasei are the manufacturing backbone, while what was originally
            Ultrafabrics oversees marketing and sales.</p>
