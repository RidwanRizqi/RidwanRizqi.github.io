    "<p>Lincoln dealers that are on board with the brand’s EV plans face a hefty upgrade bill. Automotive News reports that Lincoln dealers wanting to sell the brand’s EVs will have to drop $900,000 on upgrades to their dealerships.</p>\n" +
    "<p>Despite EV plans that still aren’t quite clear and a business strategy that shows that China is its priority, Lincoln says the EVs are coming. But they’re still three years out, with three models supposedly hitting showrooms in 2025. Despite this, Lincoln wants dealer owners to start getting ready for these vehicles. According to brand executives, it’s no biggie that they actually don’t have the vehicles to sell now: “...executives say they need to prepare now to woo younger buyers who its research shows are open to luxury EVs.” But you actually have to have EVs to sell for people to be wooed by them… anyway.</p>\n" +
    "<p>Dealers that feature both Ford and Lincoln stores have it slightly worse. They have to make their EV investments separately. Remember, Ford dealers have to drop $1.2 million to upgrade their dealerships, meaning a Ford/Lincoln dealer will have to spend a total of over $2 million if it wants to sell EVs from both brands.</p>\n" +
    "<p>Dealers have until December 15 to make the decision on the investments. If they don’t, they have to wait until the next enrollment period in late 2026.</p>",
    "<p>Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), and the BMW Group today announced a strategic collaboration to develop customizable cloud software that will simplify the distribution and management of data from millions of connected vehicles. The BMW Group will be the first automaker to use the software, which will serve as the basis for its next-generation, cloud-based vehicle data platform. Moving forward, the new software will be available to other automakers, enabling them to easily integrate vehicle data sources, accelerate vehicle and fleet application feature development, and improve life cycle management, while delivering advanced vehicle features and more personalized driver experiences at lower costs.</p>\n" +
    "<p>“We have 20 million connected vehicles on the road today. With the launch of the ‘Neue Klasse,’ BMW’s next generation of vehicles, our offboard cloud platform, powered by AWS, will process roughly triple the volume of vehicle data compared to the current generation of BMW models,” said Nicolai Krämer, vice president of Vehicle Connectivity Platforms at the BMW Group. “Together with AWS, we will continue to create innovative solutions that enable us to develop and deliver new data-driven functions to customers worldwide, even faster.”</p>\n" +
    "<p>The BMW Group and AWS co-developed solution ingests BMW vehicle signals and fleet intelligence data, and it securely processes and routes the data in the cloud. Using AWS’s cloud infrastructure and its industry-leading security, the BMW Group ensures that its customer data is protected and processed in accordance with data privacy requirements and customer preferences. Only the BMW Group’s internal domain experts—vehicle application developers, fleet managers, data scientists, and artificial intelligence, business intelligence, and development engineers—gain access to the data via a self-service mechanism that gathers streaming vehicle data, easily adds new data sources, configures access in accordance with governance policies, and monitors the quality and health of streaming sources. The data is then combined with AWS capabilities, including analytics, machine learning, database, storage, and compute, enabling the BMW Group experts to create new vehicle features and applications.</p>\n" +
    "<p>“Rapid, data-fueled innovation is critical to unlocking next-generation vehicle capabilities for automotive organizations, particularly as the industry looks to expand electric vehicle adoption, software-defined vehicle development, new digital service paradigms, and more autonomous vehicle features,” said Sarah Cooper, general manager of AWS Industry Products at Amazon Web Services, Inc. “By teaming up with the BMW Group, we are building infrastructure today that will generate value for the next generation of vehicles. Together, we are excited to make the vision of software-defined transportation a reality and to enhance the capabilities of vehicles on the road.”</p>\n"
